📌 **42 School - Process & Piping Project**  

## 📝 Description
The **pipex** project is about handling **UNIX pipes** (`|`) to establish communication between processes.  
It replicates the behavior of the following shell command:  

```sh
< file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2  
```

This project was a great opportunity to explore **process creation, file redirection, and inter-process communication**.

## 🔥 Key Features
✅ **Mimics UNIX pipe behavior (`|`)**  
✅ **Uses `fork()`, `pipe()`, `dup2()`, and `execve()`**  
✅ **Handles file redirections (`<` and `>` in shell)**  
✅ **Manages error handling and process cleanup correctly**  

## 🏆 Result: **100% Score**
The project was successfully validated with a **100% score**, meeting all evaluation criteria. 🎉

## 📁 Files
- `pipex.h` → Contains function prototypes and required macros  
- `pipex.c` → Main function that handles process execution and piping  
- `Makefile` → Automates compilation (`all`, `clean`, `fclean`, `re`, `bonus`)  

## ⚙️ Implementation Details
The `pipex` program **creates a pipeline between two commands**, just like in a shell:
1. **Opens `file1` and `file2`**.
2. **Creates a pipe** to establish communication.
3. **Forks child processes** for `cmd1` and `cmd2`.
4. **Redirects input/output** correctly using `dup2()`.
5. **Executes commands** using `execve()`.
6. **Waits for processes to complete**.

### 🔹 **Mandatory Part**
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pipe()` | Creates a unidirectional pipe |
| `fork()` | Creates child processes to execute commands |
| `dup2()` | Redirects file descriptors for input/output |
| `execve()` | Executes commands like a shell |

### 🎯 **Bonus Features**
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| ✅ **Handles multiple pipes** (`cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3 ... | cmdn`) |
| ✅ **Supports "here_doc" (`<< LIMITER`)** for handling standard input redirection |

## 🚀 Compilation & Usage
### 🛠 **Compile the Program**
make  

### ▶️ **Run pipex**
Example usage with two commands:
```sh
./pipex infile "ls -l" "wc -l" outfile  
```

Equivalent to:
```sh
< infile ls -l | wc -l > outfile  
```
